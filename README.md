# UETT4K-Anti-UAV_updated
n recent years, incidents involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased significantly, raising concerns over security and privacy, especially concerning civilian and military facilities. Vision-based approaches, especially those employing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), show great promise in addressing the need for an accurate and cost-effective UAV detection system. However, DCNNs rely heavily on extensive and well-labeled datasets, which are essential for achieving high accuracy and effectiveness. For drone detection tasks, a dataset of high-resolution images is especially valuable, as it provides more contextual information for DCNNs, enabling more accurate drone detection. This work presents a new drone detection dataset composed of 4K resolution images named, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila 4K Anti-UAV (UETT4K Anti-UAV). The dataset is created by obtaining real-world videos of a set of different types of drones in diverse environmental and challenging conditions. A custom dataset of 33601 images, manually annotated with hand-labeled bounding boxes, is created from these videos. We used our dataset to train, validate, and test eight state-of-the-art YOLOv6v3 algorithm models. The test results and qualitative analysis guide selecting the most suitable model for drone detection applications. The proposed extensive 4K dataset offers a valuable resource for effectively training deep learning models to accurately detect drones across diverse conditions.
